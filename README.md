I have recently designed a script based on the integration of GPT-Engineer, made available by https://github.com/Metim0l/free-gpt-engineer. I have decided to share this script with you. It is a graphical manager specifically developed to optimize the user experience of the Free-GPT-Engineer program. This file is the result of numerous hours of work, aiming to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for seamless manipulation and control of the program's functionalities. I hope that this tool proves valuable to you in your own projects

### Hello everyone!

Specify what you want it to build, the AI asks for clarification, and then builds it.

#### Free-GPT-Engineer is made to be easy to adapt, extend, and make your agent learn how you want your code to look. It generates an entire codebase based on a prompt.
It **absolutely FREE.** You don't need to using Openai API Key.

This project based on the [GPT-Engineer repository](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer), version **0.0.7**

## Project philosophy
- Simple to get value
- Flexible and easy to add new own "AI steps". See `steps.py`.
- Incrementally build towards a user experience of:
  1. high level prompting
  2. giving feedback to the AI that it will remember over time
- Fast handovers back and forth between AI and human
- Simplicity, all computation is "resumable" and persisted to the filesystem
